4. Set up the MySQL database:
- Create a new database in MySQL (e.g., `codesphere_db`).
- Import the provided SQL file (if available):
  ```
  mysql -u username -p codesphere_db < database.sql
  ```
5. Configure environment variables:
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following values:
  ```
  DB_HOST=localhost
  DB_USER=your_mysql_username
  DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
  DB_NAME=codesphere_db
  ```
6. Start the application:
npm start

7. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, users can:

1. Register or log in to create a personalized account.
2. Explore computer science topics like algorithms, data structures, and databases through interactive tutorials.
3. Take quizzes after each topic to test their understanding.
4. View their quiz results and track their progress over time.
5. Provide feedback on tutorials or suggest improvements directly through the platform.

### Example Workflow:
1. Log in with your credentials.
2. Select "Data Structures" from the topics menu.
3. Complete the "Binary Trees" tutorial and take the associated quiz.
4. Check your quiz score on your dashboard!
